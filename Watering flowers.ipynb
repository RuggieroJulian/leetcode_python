    "You are a gardener and you take care of your plants. The plants are planted in a row and each of them needs a specific amount of water. You are about to water them using a watering can. To avoid mistakes like applying too much water, or not watering a plant at all, you have decided to:\n",

    "- water each plant if you have sufficient water for it, otherwise refill your watering can;\n",

    "Then again you have to refill (4 steps) and water plants[4] (5 steps).\n",
