    "        - water each plant if you have sufficient water for it, otherwise refill your watering can;\n",
    "        - water each plant in one go, i.e. without taking a break to refill the watering can in the middle of watering a single plant. This means that you may sometimes have to refill your watering can before or after watering a plant, even though it's not completely empty.\n",
    "    You start at the water container, which is positioned one step before the first plant. How many steps will you take, in order to water all the plants in the row? You must take one step to move to the next or the previous plant (all plants are positioned one step apart from each other).\n",
